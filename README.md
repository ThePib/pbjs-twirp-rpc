# pbjs-twirp-rpc

A small Protobuf.js client RPC implementation for Twirp services, based on Axios.
It is used in JavaScript files generated by [`protoc-gen-twirp_javascript`](https://github.com/ThePib/protoc-gen-twirp_javascript).

### Credits

Almost, if not all of the code is originally from [`pbjs-twirp`](https://github.com/larrymyers/protoc-gen-twirp_typescript/tree/master/pbjs-twirp), with TypeScript bits taken off.
